    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    59:79:3D:B7:4D:A2:FA:14:C8:60:91:C4:2C:68:1B:89:61:F4:C1:68;button.clicker

    Successfully linked your Client ID
502398298124-dl54hu9ug3ol1r4tpaghm3dq1u7ro9sn.apps.googleusercontent.com

You only need to include the application ID (502398298124) in your Android app.
Learn more about how to do this in the developer documentation.



    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
